# Candidate Selection from Video Interview Text with NLP

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment data from video interviews to aid in candidate selection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore candidate interview data to uncover insights and patterns.
2. **Data Visualization:** Present findings through informative charts and graphs for better understanding.
3. **Sentiment Analysis with NLP (TextBlob):** Extract sentiments from transcript data using natural language processing.
4. **Decision-Making Algorithm/Code:** Develop an algorithm or code for intelligent candidate selection based on comprehensive analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Notebooks:** Contains Python notebooks for data analysis and sentiment calculation.
- **Data:** Includes CSV files with sentiment data from video interviews.
- **README.md:** This file detailing project information, features, and insights.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `notebooks` directory and run the `Emotion_analysis.ipynb` notebook to perform sentiment analysis and calculate sentiment percentages.
3. Explore the correlation between sentiment scores, time-related attributes, and speech characteristics in the `Transcript_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Installation
To run the notebooks, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- textblob

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn textblob
```

## Conclusion and Impact
Through this analysis, we delved into the intricate details of candidate interviews, uncovering a wealth of insights that go beyond mere words. From gauging confidence levels to deciphering emotions, eye contact, speech patterns, and enthusiasm, we've painted a comprehensive picture of each candidate's unique attributes.

This data-driven approach not only helps in understanding candidates better but also aids in making informed decisions during the selection process. By leveraging NLP techniques and visualizations, we were able to discern subtle nuances that set one candidate apart from another.

In essence, this project showcases the power of data analytics and NLP in revolutionizing the candidate selection process, paving the way for more efficient and insightful decision-making.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements as we continue to enhance this project and explore new possibilities in candidate selection and Natural Language Processing. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
